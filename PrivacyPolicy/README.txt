Insert here your privacy policy files, one for language.
Use the pattern "privacypolicy" + "IETF language tag (replace dash with underscore)" + ".txt"
Use ISO 639 for language and ISO 3166-1 for county.

REMEMBER TO UPDATE THE EXISTING FILES THAT YOU WANT TO KEEP. REPLACE MY AGREEMENT WITH YOUR ;)

For example:
privacypolicy_it_IT.txt
privacypolicy_en_US.txt
