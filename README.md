# DuGet
Package Manager for Delphi

## Requirement
- [GNU GetText](http://dxgettext.po.dk/Home) for translations
- [JEDI](https://github.com/project-jedi)
- [UniversalCL](https://github.com/VuioVuio/UniversalCL) by VuioVuvio

## Introduction
DuGet is a package manager for Delphi.
It is based on the [Delphinus](https://github.com/Memnarch/Delphinus) mechanism for find the packages on GitHub.
A characteristic of the DuGet Application is the fluent design that make the application similar to an UWP App.

For the translations I have used the JvGnugettext unit distributed by JEDI instead of the gnugettext.pas available at the website of GNU GetText (because it is few dated for Delphi Rio).
